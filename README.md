# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: 
RegisterNumber: 
*/
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: shankar s s
#RegisterNumber: 21002057   
def expo(a,b):
    c=a**b
    return c
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
d=print("Exponentiation of a given number:",expo(a,b))


```

## Output:

![exponentitaion ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93978702/152678762-62de9ffc-3111-448d-8dff-fae4a7af45fd.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
